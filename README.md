look-at-pi
==========

A little web based bit of javascript code to visualize really long sequences of digits (~100,000) from some renowned irrational numbers.
It interprets the numbers 9 digits at a time, translating each 9 digit chunk into a color value. It flashes the colors and their corresponding digits in a rapid sequence. !!

Future goals:
 * maybe implement some music. That could be cool.
 * have different modes of visualization; have a lot of different ideas for that, but I also enjoy the simplicity of the current version.
 * anything you want to add? Feel free, I'll totally accept it.
 * what happens when you reach the end?

Shoutouts:
  * Raphael.js: makes graphical stuff fun!
  * FitText.js: makes my big text responsive and cool!
  * Font Awesome: *cute* icons
  * MathJax: makes math text in browser a real thing!
