==========

A little bit of javascript code to visualize irrational numbers.
Right now its doing some fun stuff with five whole numbers!
Future goals:
 * maybe implement some music. That could be cool.
 * have different modes of visualization; have a lot of different ideas for that, but I also enjoy the simplicity of the current version.
 * anything you want to add? Feel free, I'll totally accept it.
